# first-page
**Level:** Beginner
**Concept:** Basic elements of HTML
**Contains:** HTML, CSS

First Page consists of three pages: index, another page, and a form.

This exercise was modified from its original parameters to consist of four panels instead of three pages. The panels use in-page anchors for navigation. This alteration was made to keep the exercise to a single page.
